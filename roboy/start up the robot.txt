0. Plug in power cable
The multi plug directly connects the four AC/DC converters
and the 12V supply for beamer, USB-Hub and cameras
so just connect the multi plug

--------------------------

1. Start up laptop

--------------------------

2.1. Connect USB-Hub (Cameras, Mic, Speaker) with laptop [USB]
2.2. Connect Can-Bus (Motors) with laptop [USB]
2.3. Connect mini beamer with laptop [HDMI]

--------------------------

3.1. Start up mini beamer (by pressing the small button on its side)
3.2. Go to HDMI mode with the mini beamer
(if remote control is lost, there are setup buttons on the bottom of the beamer)
3.3. Go to the laptop's settings -> settings manager -> display
and make sure the external monitor is set to 'use this output'

--------------------------

4.1. Start up the speaker (blue light should be on), make sure volume is turned up
4.2. Go to the sound settings on the laptop
and make sure the input and output is set to the external audio adapter

--------------------------

5.1. Power on the 4 AC/DC converters for the motors
5.2. Open terminal and go to
$ cd trunk/bin/src/roboy/tools/RoboyTensionControl/
5.3. Take Roboy's right arm

WATCH OUT! When moving the arm, always hold on the shoulder joint with one hand.
It is a REAL pain in the ass when the joint falls out. The motors will suck in the wire
before you can react and press e and Enter to stop it. You will have to use RoboySingleMotorControl
for all the arm muscles to loosen the shoulder to get it back in!!!)

and run
$ ./RightArmTensionControl
Put the right Arm into the initialization position and
first press the key
e,
then press
Enter

Initialization Position: Make sure the red part of the wire of Motor 22 and Motor 19 
is just outside of the motor unit (ask Serge or Pey Yuen to show you that).
The other Motors dont have to be correct.
Also Make sure The red lines on the back of the elbow are just visible.
(if you get CAN sending Errors, Check if the Cables are attached to Roboy's back
and if the emergency button is not pressed)

5.4. Repeat the same for the left arm.

Initialization Position: Make sure the red/green part of the wire of most of the Motors in the front 
is just outside of the motor unit. The motor unit is marked with the correct color you have to check.
(Will not work for all motors. Just try to get close to exact.
Ask Serge or Pey Yuen to show you that).

--------------------------

6.1. Go to
$ cd ../RoboyInitialization/
6.2. Run
$ ./RoboyInitialization
check if there are errors (red statements) displayed in the terminal.
Except for motors 1,2,19,25,26 (for these errors are ok)
If necessary, scroll back to check if there are errors.

WATCH OUT! If there are Init Errors, Roboy will not run correctly and potentially damage its wires.
If there are some, try to put the 'problematic motor' slightly into another position over TensionControl,
and then run RoboyInitialization again.

6.3. Run
$ ./manualInitMotor19
6.4. check if hand motors are in the correct 0-position
0-Position: Fore arms fully open (thumbs pointing out, not in or up), hands fully open

If not, go to
$ cd ../RoboySingleMotorControl
and run
$ ./RoboySingleMotorControl
then adjust 1, 2, 25, 26 so that hands and fore arms are open

WATCH OUT! You may damage its wires if turning too much into one direction.
- Check current position
- Make sure you chose '1' for position control
- Move in small steps first to get a feeling (e.g. in steps of 5000)

6.5.
Go back to the tools/RoboyInitialization folder if you left it
run
$ ./manualInit
6.6.
Go to
$ cd ../RoboySingleMotorControl
and run
$ ./RoboySingleMotorControl
check if motor 22 is around 250000. NOT 150000. If this is the case, try again from step 5.3.
(you can leave the left arm)
Do not move the motor. Just exit and run
$ ./RoboySingleMotorControl
again. check motor 19. Should be at 353362.

--------------------------

7.1. Open a new terminal tab
Go to
$ cd trunk/bin/src/roboy/main
7.2.
Run the State Machine:
$ ./RoboyStateMachine ../../../../roboy/database/configuration/ConfigStateMachine.conf
(if the cameras don't work and cause segfault crashes, then you can take the ConfigStateMachineNoVision.conf)
7.3.
click first on the GUI which is opening up and then change modes by pressing keys on the laptops keyboard
(the speaker always needs 5sec to start up, so the first word in the first behaviour will probably not sound)

--------------------------

8.1. (optional)
for starmind control mode:
Open a new terminal tab
$ cd trunk/RoboyStarmindGUI
$ java -jar starmindCockpit.jar
in the starmind Roboy Cockpit: click connect (leave port at 30000, address localhost)
go to a certain mode from there or to mode 5 to control the robot over the cockpit

--------------------------

9.1. Exit by clicking on the GUI with the mouse and then press escape
9.2. Shut down by powering off the AC/DC converters, the beamer (press the button on it) and the computer
9.3. If Roboy's spine is very loose and it may fall of its table or possibly overuse it's
spine wires after powering off, then goto RoboyTensionControl, run ./SpineTensionControl,
hold Roboy in a straight position, wait until motors have pulled in, press e and Enter and then
power off everything.
