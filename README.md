This is the data of the original Roboy as it has been conceived by the Roboy Project (www.roboy.org)

The data is courtesy of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Zurich.

If you plan on building hardware from the CAD files, we strongly encourage to contact us at info@roboy.org beforehand, as a lot of experience has been gathered by building roboy and some changes were made during the build process manually that are not reflected in the files.
